# Core values

These are the core values of our Remote Team:

## Customer Focus

Triple focus on customers (our customers, their customers, end customers). Maybe also internal customers and valued partners.

What this means for Cartman:

- We provide solutions that deliver value for customers, rather than generic one-size-fits-all solutions.
- We’re not selling products, we’re selling solutions that suit for customer
- We aim to build long-term strategic partnerships with our customers
- We'll go the extra mile with the customer.

## Wellbeing

We care about each other’s well-being. We work in sustainable manner and raise up any issues we might have and ask each other how we’re doing. We treat each other with respect.

Our solutions last for long term and are friendly for environment. Our solutions should not excessively waste computing resources.

## Trust and Transparency

- We communicate to our customers and partners with good intentions and transparency.
- We don’t hide bad news or challenges in our projects. We try to plan and flag possible issues beforehand.
- We share all documents, documentation and project updates with our clients.
- We aim to document projects and information in a way, that customer doesn’t need to rely on specific persons being available to resolve issues, or is vendor-locked due to lack documentation.
- By default we trust each other.

## Work Smarter

- Re-usable solutions that scale and can be used on different sets of data
- We adhere to YAGNI-principle (you ain’t gonna need it): it means avoid implementing features and are not needed right now
- We aim to make informed and data-driven decisions, not just based on gut feeling
- Ask ideas and feedback when in doubt
