# Security policy

This policy describes practices all employees and contractors of Cartman Digital are expected to follow. 

## **Password Management**

We use a secure password manager, 1Password, for storing and sharing all passwords and sensitive information. No passwords should be saved in browsers or plain text files, or written down physically.

Shared sensitive logins or secrets provided by customers should be placed into a vault named with customerâ€™s name. Such vault must be deleted after customer is no longer customer of Cartman.

## **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

All employees are required to enable 2FA for all accounts, where available, especially for email, cloud services, and any other software containing sensitive company data.

## **Data Encryption**

Full disk encryption must be enabled on all company and employee-owned devices used for work purposes. This includes laptops, desktops, and mobile devices.

## **Access Management**

Access to company resources should be granted on a need-to-know basis. When an employee's role changes or an employee leaves the company, their access permissions should be promptly updated or revoked. Individual accounts and passwords are strongly preferred over shared accounts. Where shared accounts must be used, they must be placed into shared 1Password vault.

## **Device Security**

All devices must be locked when not in use, and automatically lock within 10 minutes.

## **Personal Device Use**

Personal devices used for work purposes (BYOD) must adhere to all the above guidelines.

## **Incident Reporting**

Any suspected security incidents, breaches, or vulnerabilities should be reported immediately to the designated security officer, [Paavo Pokkinen](slack://user?team=T051F1E4FBP&id=U051LDSES20).

## **Security Training**

All employees will receive regular training about security best practices and how to avoid common threats, like phishing attacks.

## **SSH Key Management**

All SSH private keys should be stored in a secure and encrypted manner in 1Password. 

## **Software Updates**

Keep all software, including security software and operating systems, up-to-date to protect against the latest threats.
