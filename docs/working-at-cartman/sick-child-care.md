# Sick Child Care Benefit

In accordance with Finnish law, employees are entitled to take up to four days off to care for a child under the age of 10 who has suddenly fallen ill.

At Cartman, we provide an additional sick child care benefit under the following conditions:

- You have a sick child or children under the age of 10.
- Taking time off would significantly impact customer project(s).
- There is no other caregiver available, such as a spouse or grandparent, to look after the child.

The benefit is available on working days between 6:00 AM and 6:00 PM, with a minimum usage period of four hours. Provider of the care is [ONNI lastenhoito](https://www.onnion.fi/julkiset-palvelut/lastenhoitopalvelut). The care is available in major cities: Helsinki, Vantaa, Espoo, Kauniainen, Jyväskylä, Oulu, Tampere, Turku and Lahti.
