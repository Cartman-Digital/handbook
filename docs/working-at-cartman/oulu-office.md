## Keys and Access

Physical access to the office is managed using NFC tags. You can request a key from [Paavo Pokkinen](slack://user?team=T051F1E4FBP&id=U051LDSES20).

Important points to note:

- The office is accessible 24/7.
- There is no reception in the building.
- To enter through the front door during the evening or night, first show the key to the reader, then enter the PIN followed by *. The key reader can be a bit sensitive: when the keyboard shows a yellow light, you can enter the PIN.
- There are key readers inside the building as well. Some locks are not compatible with cliq2 keys; do not forcibly try to insert the key into these locks.
