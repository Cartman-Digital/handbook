To pay attention to:

- Office can be entered 24/7
- There is no reception in the building
- Entering through front door requires first showing the key to the reader, and after that entering PIN, and *. Reading the key can be bit flimsy: when the keyboard shows yellow light, the PIN can be entered.
- There are key readers also inside the building. Some locks are not compatible with cliq2 keys, do not forcibly try to push the key to the lock.
