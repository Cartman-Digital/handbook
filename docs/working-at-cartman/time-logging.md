# Time logging

The majority of Cartman's business relies on timely and accurate hour logging, making adherence to the time logging policy crucial and mandatory for all employees. Maintaining accurate records of work hours is not only a matter of operational efficiency but also a critical aspect of maintaining the company's reputation for reliability and professionalism.

## General Time Logging Policy

- Hours worked must be logged daily into Harvest.
- Time entries should include a brief description of the tasks performed. This can be entered in the "daily" mode in Harvest.
- If the work performed is linked to a particular task, include the ticket or task ID from the project management system as the first word in time entries for customer projects.
- The expected time logged per day is, on average, 7.5 hours, or 37.5 hours per week.
- The time logged can vary per day but should meet the expected total on a calendar month basis.
    - For example, if there are 21 working days in a month, the expected hours worked are 157.5 hours.
- Each individual is responsible for ensuring their hours are reported accurately and they have worked the expected amount.
- Any internal work should be logged into ***[INT] Internal time*** project in Harvest. Internal time is any time spent on:
    - marketing & sales
    - improving our internal tools or processes
    - Hiring & HR
    - Company events, excl. short coffee breaks
    - Self-studies

- All absences, whether paid or unpaid, should be logged into ***[ABS] Absences & time off*** project. Note that any absences must be approved by a manager or, in the case of sickness-related absence, reported to the manager as soon as possible. Only employees should report absences, contractors do not report them to Harvest.

### Task types

Different projects consist of various task types. Typically, it is clear which task type to select, such as "Software development" or "Design".

When logging time for customer projects, non-billable task types should generally not be used. However, there are two exceptions:

1. The customer responsible person can log time under "*Business Development*", which typically includes activities like sales discussions or handling inquiries related to invoicing or complaints.
2. Write-off task type should not be logged unless instructed. The customer responsible person is responsible for making write-off decisions by moving any such time entries to this task type.

## Instructions on time logging

To log time:

1. Select “Time” menu from Harvest
2. Select “day” from the view. Time logs containing notes can be logged only from this week.
3. Ensure you are in correct day, and then press track time -button
4. Select correct project and task. Please note correct task type. Write a note and submit the time log.

## How to write a good time entry note

Good entry note should contain description what was done, but shouldn’t be overly long and detailed. Some good and bad examples are below:

### Good examples

- ACME-34 Read through existing project specification document. Create internal notes and write up questions.
- ACME-34 Meeting with client on integration architecture, documenting the findings on the report
- ACME-76 Create footer, apply page titles, start frontpage implementation
- ACME-3 Implement Metosin Malli to API gateway, verify spec of Cart API response.

### Bad examples

- Debugging
- Investigations and debugging
- Coding

## Tips and recommendations

- Keep in mind amount of code written does not equal to amount of time logged! Sometimes we’re in client meetings, or discussing internally how to help client’s business: this is also client billable time. When in doubt, ask manager.
- If we’re spending time to learn a new technology or improving our own process, that time can be logged under *internal: work self-studies* with approval obtained beforehand. Any time spent learning customer tools, processes or customer’s specific technology should be logged to customer’s project.
- Lunch break is non-working time, but any other breaks should be logged to Harvest to the projects on-going at that time.
- Customer time should be always logged into customer project, even if we’re exceeding estimations, budget or time promised to customer. Our own estimations in future depend on accurate logging of time.
    - Managers or individuals handling project invoicing will manage these cases.
