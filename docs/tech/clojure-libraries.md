# Preferred Clojure Libraries and Tools

This page lists recommended Clojure libraries we use at Cartman. We should primarily use these libraries.

Criteria that are driving the list are:

- data-driven, instead of macro-driven
- Open source licensed
- Do one thing very well
- Easy to use
- Preferably are widely used and well-supported
- Have enough usage in the community and maintainers
- Address security issues promptly
